		<h1 class = "heading">Suprising Facts About: Twitter</h1>
        <img src = "../images/twitter.png" />
        <h2 class = "side-heading">First:</h2>
        <p class = "info">Twitter was actually created on a playground. The founding team members were at the top of a slide in a playground in San Francisco, when Jack Dorsey said "I've got an idea so simple that you don't even think about it - you just write."</p>
        
                
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Second:</h2>
        <p class = "info">At first glance it may seem that, unlike most websites, Twitter is advertisement free. But that's not quite true, Twitter is a business, and it does make money through cleverly disguised advertisements. Twitter has two main revenue streams, firstly Google and Bing pay Twitter a handsome license fee so that they can include tweets in their realtime search results. And secondly big brands such as Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Red Bull and many others pay Twitter for sponsored tweets which appear in Twitter search results. Brands can also pay for "promoted trends" which appear amongst the other naturally trending topics. The cost for a Promoted Trend in the United States for one day is $200,000.</p>
        
                
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Third:</h2>
        <p class = "info">When it comes to profit, Twitter is very different the likes of Facebook, Google and Apple. Because Twitter has never made a single dime of profit. In 2014 Twitter made a net loss of $578 million. Which can be attributed to its rapid expansion and excruciatingly high operating costs.</p>
        
                
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Fourth:</h2>
        <p class = "info">But why are Twitter's operating costs so high. Well, it has a lot to do with the fact that 500 million tweets are sent every day. Which is an astonishing 6,000 tweets per second. All those messages take an awful lot of processing power and storage.</p>
        
                
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Fifth:</h2>
        <p class = "info"> A single day's worth of Twitter posts would fill a 10 million page book.</p>
        
                
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Sixth:</h2>
        <p class = "info">Twitter has 288 million active monthly users. 80% of whom access the service through mobile devices.</p>
        
                
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Seventh:</h2>
        <p class = "info"> The most retweeted tweet ever was by Ellen DeGeneres with her star-studded selfie tweet at the 2014 Oscars. It got 3.4 million retweets.</p>
        
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Eighth:</h2>
        <p class = "info">44% of Twitter users have never sent a single Tweet. They just use the site for stalk people.</p>
        
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Ninth:</h2>
        <p class = "info">A report found that over 50% of Justin Bieber's Twitter followers are fake.</p>
        
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Tenth:</h2>
        <p class = "info">The FBI has a dictionary of Twitter slang.</p>
        
        <h2 class = "side-heading">Eleventh:</h2>
        <p class = "info">And finally, Twitter may not yet be making a profit but it is worth $31 billion and is the 8th most visited website on the internet. And financial analysts predict that Twitter could finally become profitable by the end of 2015, so don't give up on the old bird just yet.</p>
